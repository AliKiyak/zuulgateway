# Zuul gateway
The Zuul gateway is a load balancer that connects to our edge service. We get a URL pattern to our edge service which makes it easier to send HTTP request to our backend

## Context
The Esports wiki allows you to find every bit of information about the games, teams, tournaments and players that are involved in Espors. You can look at them in detail, add, delete or even edit them. This way you can keep your own database about your favorite esports game / team.

## Installation
* Clone our project (git clone https://github.com/AliKiyak/zuulgateway.git)

## Usage
Run the project and make sure that the Eureka Server, Edge service and the other microservices are all running.
The functionality of the service can be tested while it is isolated from the other services.

## Client
This is a school project made for the course Java Advanced Topipcs
